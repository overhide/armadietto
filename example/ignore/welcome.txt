This example is part of the https://github.com/remotestorage/armadietto 
remoteStorage server repository.

               `--------------'

  The pane on the LEFT is the actual rendered 
  example application for you to interact with.

  The TOP-RIGHT pane shows "logs" logged from this
  application. 
  
  When this example Web application's JavaScript 
  calls a "log" function, the logged message 
  appears in the TOP-RIGHT pane.

  Clicking any log message will scroll the 
  BOTTOM-RIGHT pane to the corresponding 
  JavaScript source code where this log message 
  occurs.

  The idea being: as you interact with the app
  you will see logs for various data setting
  calls, state transitions, events, and
  callbacks.  Clicking on the log will show
  you the code.  

  This way you will see how the example app uses
  remotestorage.js and how it leverages the 
  remoteStorage APIs on.
